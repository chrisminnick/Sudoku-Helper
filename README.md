# Sudoku Helper

A HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript program for quickly solving sudoku puzzles by John Lonquist.

## Usage

After opening index.html in browser click 'Restart'. Each of 81 cells on the puzzle will be filled the available options for each cell. When an option is clicked the program will set the answer for that cell as the selected option if no conflicts are created, otherwise a warning beep will sound. Any cell options deemed necessary by the previously selected options will be selected automaticly.
